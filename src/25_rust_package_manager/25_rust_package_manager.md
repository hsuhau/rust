# Rust - Package Manager

Cargo is the package manager for RUST. This acts like a tool and manages Rust projects.

Some commonly used cargo commands are listed in the table below −

| Sr.No | Command & Description                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **cargo build** Compiles the current project.                |
| 2     | **cargo check** Analyzes the current project and report errors, but don't build object files. |
| 3     | **cargo run** Builds and executes src/main.rs.               |
| 4     | **cargo clean** Removes the target directory.                |
| 5     | **cargo update** Updates dependencies listed in Cargo.lock.  |
| 6     | **cargo new** Creates a new cargo project.                   |

Cargo helps to download third party libraries. Therefore, it acts like a package manager. You can also build your own libraries. Cargo is installed by default when you install Rust.

To create a new cargo project, we can use the commands given below.

### Create a binary crate

```bash
cargo new project_name --bin
```

### Create a library crate

```bash
cargo new project_name --lib
```

To check the current version of cargo, execute the following command −

```bash
cargo --version
```

## Illustration - Create a Binary Cargo project

The game generates a random number and prompts the user to guess the number.

### Step 1 - Create a project folder

Open the terminal and type the following command *cargo new guess-game-app --bin*.

This will create the following folder structure.

```
guess-game-app/
   -->Cargo.toml
   -->src/
      main.rs
```

The *cargo new* command is used to create a crate. The *--bin* flag indicates that the crate being created is a binary crate. Public crates are stored in a central repository called crates.io https://crates.io/.

### Step 2 - Include references to external libraries

This example needs to generate a random number. Since the internal standard library does not provide random number generation logic, we need to look at external libraries or crates. Let us use **rand** crate which is available at crates.io website [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

The https://crates.io/crates/rand is a rust library for random number generation. Rand provides utilities to generate random numbers, to convert them to useful types and distributions, and some randomness-related algorithms.

The following diagram shows crate.io website and search result for rand crate.

![external libraries](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/images/external_libraries.jpg)

Copy the version of rand crate to the Cargo.toml file *rand = "0.5.5"*.

```
[package]
name = "guess-game-app"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Mohtashim"]

[dependencies]
rand = "0.5.5"
```

### Step 3: Compile the Project

Navigate to the project folder. Execute the command **cargo build** on the terminal window −

```
Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
Downloading rand v0.5.5
Downloading rand_core v0.2.2
Downloading winapi v0.3.6
Downloading rand_core v0.3.0
   Compiling winapi v0.3.6
   Compiling rand_core v0.3.0
   Compiling rand_core v0.2.2
   Compiling rand v0.5.5
   Compiling guess-game-app v0.1.0 
   (file:///E:/RustWorks/RustRepo/Code_Snippets/cargo-projects/guess-game-app)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1m 07s
```

The rand crate and all transitive dependencies (inner dependencies of rand) will be automatically downloaded.

### Step 4 - Understanding the Business Logic

Let us now see how the business logic works for the number guessing game −

- Game initially generates a random number.
- A user is asked to enter input and guess the number.
- If number is less than the generated number, a message “Too low” is printed.
- If number is greater than the generated number, a message “Too high” is printed.
- If the user enters the number generated by the program, the game exits.

### Step 5 - Edit the main.rs file

Add the business logic to main.rs file.

```rust
use std::io;
extern crate rand; 
//importing external crate
use rand::random;
fn get_guess() -> u8 {
   loop {
      println!("Input guess") ;
      let mut guess = String::new();
      io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
         .expect("could not read from stdin");
      match guess.trim().parse::<u8>(){ //remember to trim input to avoid enter spaces
         Ok(v) => return v,
         Err(e) => println!("could not understand input {}",e)
      }
   }
}
fn handle_guess(guess:u8,correct:u8)-> bool {
   if guess < correct {
      println!("Too low");
      false

   } else if guess> correct {
      println!("Too high");
      false
   } else {
      println!("You go it ..");
      true
   }
}
fn main() {
   println!("Welcome to no guessing game");

   let correct:u8 = random();
   println!("correct value is {}",correct);
   loop {
      let guess = get_guess();
      if handle_guess(guess,correct){
         break;
      }
   }
}
```

### Step 6 - Compile and Execute the Project

Execute the command *cargo run* on the terminal. Make sure that the terminal points to the Project directory.

```
Welcome to no guessing game
correct value is 97
Input guess
20
Too low
Input guess
100
Too high
Input guess
97
You got it ..
```
